# Apt Install

This devcontainer feature installs a few utilities using `apt` that we either need or are just helpful for development with wasmCloud:
- curl (for downloading wash and cosmo)
- redis-server (for a simple local Key-Value store)
- redis-tools (for possible manual interaction with Redis if needed)
